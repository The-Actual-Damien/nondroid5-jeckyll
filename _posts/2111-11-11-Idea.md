    When always doing alone, the risk of failure is high.
    The potential for growth decreases.
    I want to emphasize that the aloof programmer doesn't exist.
    Even so、It is not possible to achieve a superhuman feat by one person.
    "Achievement change the world"
    It is the result of dramatic inspiration and efforts of team.

        Software development is a team sport
    
    Humility
        You're not in the center of the world.
        You are not a omnipotent, nor is it not absolutely correct.
        Always, Let's improve myself.    
    
    Respect
        Sincerely I think trying to do the things people working together.
        Treat the opponent as a person, and try to appreciate the abilities and achievements.
    
    Trust
        People other than your own is a competent, I will believe to be the right thing.
        That way, it is possible to leave the job.
        
    There is no need to be wary when you write the software.
    Teammate is a companion, not a competitor.
